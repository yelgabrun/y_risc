This is a project for myself to get more comfortable with computer architecture/organization concepts through first hand practice.
For now, this is a WIP implementation of a basic unpipelined RISC-V processor implementing an RV32I ISA.
I'm currently using open-source tools for compilation of SV files (icarus verilog with GTKWave for simulation/debugging) and planning to use an opensource flow (namely Qflow) to do everything thereafter (synthesis/STA/PnR/etc).
