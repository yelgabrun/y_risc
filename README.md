This is a rough project for myself to get more comfortable with computer architecture concepts through first hand practice.
For now, this is an ongoing implementation of a basic unpipelined MIPS processor. More to come :)
I'm currently using opensource tools for compilation of SV files (icarus verilog with GTKWave) and planning to use an opensource flow (namely Qflow) to do everything thereafter: synthesis/STA/P&R.
